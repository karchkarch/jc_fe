                "The steamer doesn't come!" he exclaimed, as the port clock struck. "She can't be far off now," returned his companion. 
                "How long will she stop at Suez?" "Four hours; long enough to get in her coal.  It is thirteen hundred and ten miles from 
                Suez to Aden, at the other end of the Red Sea, and she has to take in a fresh coal supply." "And does she go from Suez 
                directly to Bombay?" "Without putting in anywhere." "Good!" said Fix.  "If the robber is on board he will no doubt get 
                off at Suez, so as to reach the Dutch or French colonies in Asia by some other route.  He ought to know that he would not 
                be safe an hour in India, which is English soil." "Unless," objected the consul, "he is exceptionally shrewd.  An English 
                criminal, you know, is always better concealed in London than anywhere else." This observation furnished the detective food 
                for thought, and meanwhile the consul went away to his office.
